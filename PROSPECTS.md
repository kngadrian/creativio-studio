## 🔥 Immediate Outreach Channels (Do Now)

### 1. Reddit (Highest ROI for cold outreach)
Post helpful comments + offer in these subs:

- **r/Etsy** (2M+ members) — Look for "no sales" / "need help with photos" posts
- **r/ecommerce** — "How to improve product photos" threads
- **r/Shopify** — New store owners asking for help
- **r/smallbusiness** — People launching product businesses
- **r/AmazonSeller** — Sellers needing better listing photos
- **r/Entrepreneur** — "Just launched my product" posts
- **r/sweatystartup** — Service business ideas (you ARE the service)

**Strategy**: Don't spam your link. Find posts where someone is asking about product photos or struggling with sales. Give genuine advice, then mention "I actually do this as a service — happy to do a free sample" with your link.

**Sample Reddit comment**:
> Great product! Honestly your photos are the #1 thing holding you back. Contextual lifestyle imagery nearly doubles conversion rates. I run an AI photo studio — I could do a free sample of one of your products so you can see the difference. Here's my site if you're curious: [link]. No pressure either way, just thought I'd offer!

### 2. Facebook Groups (Warm audiences)
Join and post/comment in:

- "Etsy Sellers" (multiple large groups)
- "Shopify Entrepreneurs"  
- "E-commerce Product Photography"
- "Amazon FBA Sellers"
- "Small Business Owners" (various)
- "Handmade Sellers"

**Strategy**: Post a before/after image transformation with a caption like:
> "Turned a basic phone photo into this premium lifestyle shot using AI in under 60 seconds. If any sellers want a free sample of their product, drop a comment! I'm offering 5 premium photos for $49 this week."

### 3. Instagram DMs (Direct targeting)
Search hashtags:
- #etsyseller #handmadebusiness #shopifystore #smallbusinessowner
- #productphotography #ecommercetips #newbusiness

Find accounts with <10K followers that have mediocre product photos. DM them the script from OUTREACH.md.

### 4. Twitter/X Posts
Post before/after threads showing transformations. Tag #ecommerce #shopify #etsy #productphotography

### 5. Your Existing Email List
You already have an email list from the blueprint campaign. Send a quick email:
> "Hey [NAME], quick question — do you sell physical products? I just launched an AI product photography service and I'm doing 5 premium photos for $49 this week as a launch special. If you're interested (or know someone who is), check it out: [link]"

## 📝 Before/After Content to Create

I can generate before/after comparison images using CreativioAI to use in your posts. We already have the product cover image. We need:

1. A "before" basic product photo (phone quality)
2. An "after" CreativioAI-generated premium version
3. Side-by-side comparison graphic

This is your proof-of-concept that sells the service.

## 💰 Revenue Math

| Scenario | Sales Needed | Total |
|---|---|---|
| All Starter | 4 × $49 | $196 |
| Mixed | 2 × $49 + 1 × $97 | $195 |
| Growth focus | 2 × $97 | $194 |
| One Agency | 1 × $197 | $197 |
| **Best case** | **1 × Growth + 1 × Agency** | **$294** |

Realistically, landing 2-3 orders from aggressive posting in FB groups + Reddit + DMs in 12 hours is very doable.
